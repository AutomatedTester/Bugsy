# How to Contribute

Firstly, thanks for wanting to contribute back to this project. Below are
guidelines that should hopefully minimise the amount of backwards and forwards
in the review process.

## Getting Started

* Fork the repository on GitHub - well... duh :P
* Create a virtualenv: `virtualenv venv`
* Activate the virtualenv: `. venv/bin/activate`
* Install the package in develop mode: `python setup.py develop`
* Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the tests to check that everything was successful: `py.test tests`

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    /my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the main repository
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two
  weeks will may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
